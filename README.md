# todos.js and App.vue

Thoug all errors would be catched, but they are not.
Get a lot of error massages when running without todo.api.
First fetch GET fetch error seems to be catched, and dummy Popup is shown,
but then I get alot of error messages, which ar unfortunatly not catched.
Thougt that every error within try{} would be catched, but this dosen't happen.
